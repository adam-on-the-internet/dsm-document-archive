# Mayor Cownie Statement on April 18, 2022 

Before we adjourn for the night, I'd like to take a moment and update you on some
upcoming meetings related to the operations and policies of the Des Moines Police Department.

On April 27th, during a City Council work session, the independent consulting group *Public Works, LLC*
will issue their report on law enforcement and data collection specific to DMPD. 
This organization has consulted cities throughout the country and worked hand in hand with our citizen-based
*Police and Practice Review Committee* or *PPRC* that we formed two years ago.

The *Public Works, LLC* report- based on more than 100 interviews with residents and local leaders- will recommend
the initial steps necessary to move toward greater community engagement.

Tentatively, during the week of May 16th, a City Council work session will discuss the expanded
role of the PPRC as an advisory board. During that meeting we will also address the scope of work needed
to attain national accreditation and its benefit to our residents.

Right now, we are reviewing and vetting several qualified contractors who specialize in police
management services including accreditation.
My expectation is that during our June 13th meeting, Council will consider awarding a contract for this
indepdent, third-party consultant so that we can begin the process to thoroughly analyze DMPD's policies, training programs
and principles.

In closing, over these past two weeks, I've heard from residents, council members and staff...and I want
to thank everyone for their input on this important issue.
I'm encouraged by these latest developments and confident that we are moving in a positive and forthright manner.

Without a doubt, we have much work ahead, but I am hopeful that over the next two months, we will see movement that 
assists our police department in best serving all Des Moines neighborhoods and residents.
