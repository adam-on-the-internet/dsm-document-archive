# 2/21/22 Legal Opinion Remarks

At the 2/21/22 DSM Council Meeting, Mayor Cownie made remarks about a 
Legal Opinion they obtained regarding to the legality of Council Members
voting in favor of their campaign donors.

People submitted FOIA requests for the Legal Opinion, but the City called the Legal Opinion
"confidential attorney client communications" in response to this request, and returned a transcript
of the "prepared remarks" instead.

## Transcript

I just want to clarify for the record that this issue was raised at a prior meeting, 
so we asked our Legal Department for a Legal Opinion on the issue.  
That opinion was then vetted by the largest municipal law firm in the state who agreed 100% with the opinion and its findings.  
That outside counsel vetted opinion found that there is no legal conflict or apparent conflict of interest regarding campaign 
contributions made in compliance with the Iowa Campaign Disclosure Act.  

A recipient of campaign finance contributions cannot spend those segregated funds for personal expenses under the law, 
so there can be no pecuniary interest in the funds held by a candidateâ€™s committee for restricted campaign expenses and not 
otherwise available to a candidate.

## Other Notes

We believe the "largest municipal law firm in the state" refers to Nyemaster Goode, P.C., but this is not confirmed.
